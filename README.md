# Functional Facebook Clone

## What, Why, and HOW
With this project, I wanted to put my design skills to the test by replicating the design of Facebook. I know it can be tricky for companies to evaluate the skills of entry-level/junior-level engineers. I hope that replicating the design of one of the top websites in the world shows that I have the front-end chops to create simple, professional-looking, responsive web applications. Furthermore, this clone has a fully functional user login through Google, and it also has a fully functional live feed where users can make posts and attach an image/video to each post. I'm really proud of this application, and I hope you enjoy checking it out!
